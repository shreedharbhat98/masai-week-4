        <div class="displaygrid">
            <p>Often you must have read or heard that “An apple a day, keeps the doctor away”, yes! This is quite true
                as fruits play a very important role in our lives. History also state that during the early man days,
                humans would often search and live on nature’s wonderful gifts like fruits and vegetables.<br>



                They would eat them raw and live. Fruits along with vegetables have always been very essential in the
                growth and development of human life. Fruits are naturally sweet to taste, low in calories, fat, sodium
                and cholesterol. They contain many vitamins and nutrients that would reduce risk of various health
                related problems.<br>



                Fruits are rich in fiber which is very essential for the smooth movement of the digestive system. There
                are some fruits that give body energy as they contain carbohydrates which are the main source of energy.
                Carbohydrates in fruits are mainly sugar which actually breaks down easily and make a quick source of
                energy.<br>



                Fruits contain at least 90 to 95 percent water which is also an important nutrient. Basically fruit
                benefits a healthy lifestyle by giving us carbohydrates, fiber and micro-nutrients which aids our bodies
                to function properly. Fruits give you more energy than sugar or sweets as they contain natural glucose
                and fructose.<br>



                They also contain minerals, vitamins and nutrients that are useful for a healthy life. You can make
                amazing, mouth-watering and delectable sweets, desserts and juices with fresh fruits. They are easy to
                cook and digest easily. </p>
