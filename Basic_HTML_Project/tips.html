            <div id="heading"><b>Nutrients</b></div>
            <div>1. Most fruits are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. None have cholesterol.</div>
            <div>2. Fruits are sources of many essential nutrients that are underconsumed, including potassium, dietary
                fiber, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid).</div>
            <div>3. Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Fruit sources of potassium
                include bananas, prunes and prune juice, dried peaches and apricots, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, and
                orange juice.</div>
            <div>4. Dietary fiber from fruits, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels
                and may lower risk of heart disease. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce
                constipation and diverticulosis. Fiber-containing foods such as fruits help provide a feeling of
                fullness with fewer calories. Whole or cut-up fruits are sources of dietary fiber; fruit juices contain
                little or no fiber.</div>
            <div>5. Vitamin C is important for growth and repair of all body tissues, helps heal cuts and wounds, and
                keeps teeth and gums healthy.</div>
            <div>6. Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become
                pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from
                fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and
                anencephaly during fetal development.</div>

            <div id="heading"><b>Health benefits</b></div>
            <div>1. As part of an overall healthy diet, eating foods such as fruits that are lower in calories per cup
                instead of some other higher-calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie intake.</div>
            <div>2. Eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce risk for
                heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.</div>
            <div>3. Eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may protect
                against certain types of cancers.</div>
            <div>4. Adding fruit can help increase intake of fiber and potassium which are important nutrients that many
                Americans do not get enough of in their diet.</div>
